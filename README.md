## Development

### Setup

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  - If you already have corepack available but do not have pnpm, you can run `npm run setup:pnpm` in this directory to install it.
2. Run `pnpm install` in this directory to install all dependencies.
  - You can use [pnpm filters](https://pnpm.io/filtering) to only install the dependencies for a specific package.
3. Run `pnpm build:all` to build all packages.
  - This project uses [turborepo](https://turbo.build/). You can use [its filters](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/run#--filter) to build only specific packages.
